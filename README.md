mysqlclient-sys: static version
======

This Unix-only fork of [mysqlclient-sys](https://github.com/sgrif/mysqlclient-sys) contains prebuilt static binary `libmariadbclient.a` (which is compatible with `libmysqlclient.a`) and links to it. You can rebuild the binary - see `vagga.yaml` for an Alpine container instruction and `native/build.sh` for build commands.

To use it in your Diesel project, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[patch.crates-io]
mysqlclient-sys = { git = "https://github.com/kaicoh/mysqlclient-sys", rev = "74d254d" }
```

Tested with musl + Rocket + diesel! (Tip: install `musl-gcc` and put

```toml
[build]
target = "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"
```

to your project's `.cargo/config`).

Please note that `libmariadbclient` is licensed under LGPLv2.1. If you publicly distribute your statically-linked Rust program, you will need to let users relink it. Text of LGPLv2.1 is in `native/COPYING.LIB`.
